We have a few opportunities for helping out with research in Prof. Liz Moyer's group. Opportunities are open to interested undergrads and grad students!

**Haynes Stephens**

I'm studying pathogen variation in Douglas fir tussock moths and I will be in Missoula, Montana for the Summer 2020. I perform transmission experiments in the field by putting infected caterpillars on contained branches and then exposing susceptible hosts to the infected foliage. I would like a few undergraduates to help me rear insects and execute the experiments in the field. 

**Jim Franke**

I'm studying how to make my hair as tall as possible. I'll be based in Missoula Montana and doing field collections to assess within-season disease dynamics and spatial patterns.

**Ziwei Wang**

I'll be studying the gypsy moth and the fungus and the virus in Michigan. 

**Please reach out if you're interested or have any questions!**
