We have a few opportunities for helping out with research in the Dwyer lab! Most of them are field opportunities and we are very happy to discuss doing a senior thesis working with us!

I'm studying pathogen variation in Douglas fir tussock moths and I will be in Missoula, Montana for the Summer 2020. I perform transmission experiments in the field by putting infected caterpillars on contained branches and then exposing susceptible hosts to the infected foliage. I would like a few undergraduates to help me rear insects and execute the experiments in the field.
