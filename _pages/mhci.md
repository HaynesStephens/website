# Mental Health Check in

Current organizers: Katie Dixon and Sophia Horigan

The Darwin Cluster Mental Health Check in is an initiative started in July 2020. The goal of these meetings are to set up a space set aside for sharing and discussion of the 'not so great' parts of grad schooland life in general. 
We aim to uplift each other through active listening, connection, and support. While some weeks have a theme to encourage community building, it is not expected that sharing/discussions are restricted to that theme.

Currently, these meetings are set to occur every other Wednesday at 1pm. The next few sessions are:

- December 2nd, 2020
- December 16th, 2020

We also offer an [anonymous google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPIAkH9yfifr_-jYmpRRSjIm8nrxM-ENS2Wi0eD3P-xVFBGQ/viewform?fbzx=-4059902779143257446) where anyone can share thoughts or experiences at any time, with the option of them being read aloud at a meeting and/or shared with faculty. 
Name and email are optional, the form is set to not collect email addresses and is not linked to a UC email account (ee.issues(at)gmail.com). 
Please reach out if you would like help writing an anonymous statement.

The organizers collected tips for COVID Coping Mechanisms at the inaugural meeting, the info can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hQFQgpa5gqdE7WBFOI3KNXmI1WYtuTs7li-5Ydq0xzA/edit).
