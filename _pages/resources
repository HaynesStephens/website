Here is where I'll post mental health resources, mostly specific to the University of Chicago and Darwin Cluster

**[University of Chicago Student Wellness Center](https://wellness.uchicago.edu/mental-health/)**
The student wellness center offers many options for individual and group therapy, including a 24/7 therapist on call.
They can also accomodate if a person needs a private spacy for therapy and can't get it at home.
** Recently moved to their new building next to student medical services** (840 E 59th street)
