I'm a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the Geophysical Sciences Department. I work in Liz Moyer's group studying the impacts of Climate Change on agriculture around the world. I am also interested in the choices society faces in dealing with Climate Change and which choices provide the greatest global food security.
